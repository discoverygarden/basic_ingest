# Basic Ingest

## Introduction

Quality of life changes when adding Repository Items and Media to provide
automatic redirection to relevant pages and suppress form elements when only
one choice is actually correct.

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora)
* [Prepopulate](https://www.drupal.org/project/prepopulate)

## Installation

Install as usual, see
[this](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-modules) for
further information.

## Configuration

Basic Ingest attempts to help out with the process of creating Media and
selecting display hints by by maintaining a mapping of Repository Item model
URIs to Media type IDs.

This mapping lives in the configuration at `basic_ingest.settings.map`, and
contains a list of mapping objects supporting the following structure:

* `uri`: the URI of the model to apply this mapping to
* `media_type`: the ID of the media type this model should be mapped to, use media to redirect to the generic media upload page
* `display_hints`: a sequence of display hint URIs applicable to the given
Media type, to narrow down the selection list.

## Usage

Most of the improvements in this module appear automatically and don't require
any further configuration.

* Some CSS is provided to improve the user experience during ingest
* Fields with options (checkboxes, select fields, and radio buttons) are
automatically suppressed if they contain no options
* When Media are ingested, an option is given to automatically redirect to that
Media's parent
* When Repository Items are created that expect a Media to be attached, an
option is given to automatically redirect to the Media submission form
* Display hints can also be mapped to Media types so that the display hint
selection is suppressed
* The PID field is suppressed during Resource Item creation
* The link to show and hide row weights is suppressed
